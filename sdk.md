Improve how nodes are positioned and edges bahave:
- BPMN Shape default size:
  - Element: 100x80
  - Gateway: 36x36
- Create a virtual grid of 200x160 grid items
  - All bpmn elements must be placed in one grid item
  - If an element is too big, then merge grid items so that it fits
  - Within the grid items the elements are vertically and horizontally centered
- On gateway splits: if one path has an early return, it's never on the base line
- Outgoing paths: for all elements but gateways, all outgoing paths must leave the element on the right side, vertically centered
- Incoming paths: for all elements but gateways, all incoming paths must connect the element on the left side, vertically centered
- Starting Gateways: incoming paths always connect on the left side, vertically centered
- Closing gateways: incoming paths connect from the positioning:
  - above gateway: from the top
  - below gateway: from the bottom
  - left to the gateway: from the left
- Always prefer L-shaped edges over Z-shaped ones. Use Z-shaped edges only if not possible differently
- Elements may never overlap
